# **PrivifyAI: Privacy by Design**  
PrivifyAI is a **privacy-first face recognition system** that ensures biometric data security without compromising performance. By integrating **Federated Learning, Homomorphic Encryption, and Differential Privacy**, PrivifyAI enables secure face recognition while preventing unauthorized access to raw facial data.  

## **🔒 Core Technologies**  
### 1️⃣ **Federated Learning**  
- **Library**: Flwr (Flower)  
- **How It Works**: Facial embeddings are processed locally on user devices, ensuring **no centralized data storage**. Only model updates—not personal data—are shared with the central system, reducing privacy risks.  

### 2️⃣ **Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**  
- **Library**: TenSEAL  
- **How It Works**: Face matching is performed on **encrypted data** using the **CKKS scheme** and cosine similarity. The similarity score is revealed only with user consent.  
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted embeddings are stored in a **Neo4j graph database**, enabling efficient relationship mapping while maintaining security.  

### 3️⃣ **Differential Privacy**  
- **Library**: Opacus  
- **How It Works**: Controlled noise is injected during training, ensuring individual identities remain indistinguishable in aggregated analyses. Even in the event of a data breach, attackers cannot reverse-engineer personal data. 🛡️

## **⚙️ How It Works: Technical Overview**  
- **Real-Time Face Recognition**:
  - **Face Detection**: Powered by **OpenCV**.  
  - **Feature Extraction**: Uses **MobileNetV2** to generate **384-dimensional facial embeddings**, capturing essential facial features while discarding raw images.  
- **Django-Based Web Dashboard**:
  - **Built with Django**, offering an intuitive interface for administrators.  
  - **Role-Based Access Control** for secure management of CCTV integrations and analytics.

## **🔍 Why PrivifyAI Stands Out?**  
✅ **Privacy by Design**: No raw facial data is stored—only encrypted embeddings, ensuring biometric security.  
✅ **Regulatory Compliance**: Aligns with **GDPR** and **CCPA** standards, making it future-proof for organizations under strict privacy laws.  
✅ **Ethical AI**: Prevents surveillance overreach and algorithmic bias through **Federated Learning and Differential Privacy**.

## **🚀 The Future of PrivifyAI**  
PrivifyAI is not just a project—it’s a blueprint for ethical AI. Future iterations aim to:  
- **Develop a fully functional product**, proving the feasibility of privacy-first face recognition.  
- **Create a plug-and-play module** to integrate seamlessly with existing hardware systems.  
- **Expand the web dashboard** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** functionality for enhanced insights.
